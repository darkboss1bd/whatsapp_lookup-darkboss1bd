# üîë API Key (RapidAPI)

NAME | KEY |
| ------------------- |-------------- |
| [Whatsapp OSINT](https://rapidapi.com/inutil-inutil-default/api/whatsapp-osint) |  üîë (Required) |

- Choose a plan ‚Üí [Basic](https://rapidapi.com/inutil-inutil-default/api/whatsapp-osint/pricing)  
- Copy your **API Key**  
- Rename the file `.env.example` to `.env`  
- And add your API Key in the `.env` file

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Configure the .env file with your API

In the root of your project, run:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
üîπ This creates a new file named .env with the same content as .env.example.

üîπ .env.example remains intact (serves as a template).

üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Open the .env file for editing

Use nano (or any editor like vim or VS Code):
```bash
nano .env
```

üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Edit the variables

Inside nano you will see something like this (example):

RAPIDAPI_KEY=tu_api_key_aqui

üëâ You must fill the values with the correct data for your local environment.
For example:

RAPIDAPI_KEY=yysnssksls536m3mdlldldmdddlld

üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Save changes in nano

Press Ctrl + O ‚Üí means ‚ÄúWrite Out‚Äù (save).

It will ask for confirmation of the name (.env), press Enter.

Exit the editor with Ctrl + X.

üõ†Ô∏è Step 5: Verify it was saved

Run:
```bash
cat .env
```
